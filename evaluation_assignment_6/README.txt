All code is functional, functions work for all numerical inputs.

Test cases shown in tiny_float_testing, uncomment definition of ADD_DEBUG or MULT_DEBUG to run test cases.

Uncomment definition of DEBUG in tiny_float.c to see debug text for each case (there is a lot)

use make or make tiny_float_testing to make executable named tiny_float_testing
