Current state of program:

All functions tested. See binary_tree_testing.c and arrays_testing.c to view test cases used. 

Use make, make binary_tree_testing, or make arrays_testing to create executables that will run tests for the binary trees and linked lists respectively.

pretty much everything should handle invalid inputs well.
